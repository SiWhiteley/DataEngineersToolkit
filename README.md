# DataEngineersToolkit

The Azure cloud platform has a vast array of data tools, more than we’ve ever been faced with before, but when you’re first starting on your cloud journey it can be a daunting task to pick the right tool for the job. In this session, Simon talks about how the role of the “data engineer” has evolved and how we can use each of the various options to build out a modern data architecture. There will be a walk through the most common tools in his arsenal – Data Factory, Azure Synapse and Azure Databricks and how they fit with tools you may be familiar with in traditional warehousing such as on-prem SQL Server and SSIS. There will be time for some deeper questions, so bring along your scenarios, use-cases and queries and we’ll talk through some different examples.
